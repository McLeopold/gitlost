## Synopsis

**GitLost** is a Git Repository graph visualizer and manipulator that runs in the browser. 

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run the install command from PowerShell: `npm install -g gitlost`
3. Associate Node.js as the default program for running _*.js_ files.

#### Windows 10:
* Open Windows Control panel in the following location: `Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set your default programs`
* Scroll down and click `Choose default apps by file type`.
* Scroll down to the _.js_ entry.  In the right-hand column, click the corresponding program to change the default.  
* Choose `Node.js: Server-side JavaScript`.  If it does not appear in the list (it probably won't), perform the following steps:
  1. Create a new file, `temp.js`, on your desktop (or somewhere else if you'd prefer).
  1. Right-click the file, and select `Open With -> Choose another app`
  1. Scroll-down and click the `More Apps ↓` link. Keep scrolling and then click the `Look for another app on this PC` link.
  1. Navigate your Program Files directly to the install location for **Node.exe**.  This will most likekly be located at `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe` if you choose the x64 install in step #1.
  1. `Node.js: Server-side JavaScript` should now appear as a default option for running *_.js* files.  You will need to close and re-open the `Choose default apps by file type` window from an earlier step.
  1. You may delete the `temp.js` file created earlier.
  
#### Other versions of Windows
  * Open Windows Control panel in the following location: `Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set Associations`
  * Scroll down to the _.js_ entry.  Click to highlight, then click the `Change program` button (upper-right)
  * From the App Selection window that opens, scroll-down and click the `More Apps ↓` link. Keep scrolling and then click the `Look for another app on this PC` link.
  * Navigate your Program Files directly to the install location for **Node.exe**.  This will most likekly be located at `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe` if you choose the x64 install in step #1.

5. **ENJOY!**
